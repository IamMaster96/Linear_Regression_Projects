This is a work in progress. Goal is to apply the learned knowledge of supervised machine learning to real-world data.

We have the CO2 emmission data for 217 countries acrooss the years 2019-2022. We will buld a Linear Regression model for the CO2 emission as a LR of various features using the data for a subset of the 217 countries as training data. We can then test our model on the remaining countries as the test set. 

A second step in the project could be to see how our model works across the years.
